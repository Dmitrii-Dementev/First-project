Lovely is the feelin' now
Fever, temperatures risin' now
Power (oh power) is the force the vow
That makes it happen

It asks no questions why (Ooh)
So get closer (closer now)


Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom, keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 'cause your theories catch fire

I can't find your silver lining
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech, it's tiring
Enough is enough
